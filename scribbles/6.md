###Hey HackerNews !

I'm seeing a lot of [comments on this story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5940353), and one by [rhplus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rhplus) got my attention :
>[...]It's pretty fair to say that the combination of content, scripts and headers for almost any page you see on the internet has been uniquely crafted for you and your browser.[...]

I surely agree that each layers that enables your computer to display a web page - which is just a specific arrangement of pixels - makes it unique.
All those layers are aiming to have you, the end user, seeing the same page that someone would see under a totally different environment.
This remind me of [this excellent article](https://plus.google.com/112218872649456413744/posts/dfydM2Cnepe) which emphasis on the dizzying depth of a simple webpage display.

*My process was actually the opposite*, as instead of combining many layers of technologies to display the same arrangement of pixels, I used one to be sure that this arrangement would be different.

###Original story
You may have noticed the little graph line appearing at the end of each pages of this site.
Yes, right at the bottom. Hover your mouse on it. See, it animates! \* *Giggles* \*

When I started to build [this website](http://alexiscreuzot.com/) I wanted to have something more, **something dynamic and fun**, kind of a signature. I had fiddled with [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.com/) before and it occured to me that I could build a light visualization based on random numbers.

I came up with this algorithm :
```javascript
      var w = holder.width();
      var h = holder.height();
      var padding = 5;

      function randomPath() {
        var length = Math.round(w/8);
        var path = "";
        var   x = 0;
        var   y = 0;

        for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            curY = Math.round(Math.random() * (h-padding));

            if(i==0){
                path += "M"+0+","+curY;
            }else{
                x += Math.round(w/length);
                y = curY;
                path += "," + [x, y];
            }
        }
        return path;
      }
```

You can see that the number of points of the graph is based on the width of my container, and the y offset of each of those is based on its height (minus a padding).I chose the container to be a rectangle of 150x25 pixels.

**So now you we can calculate how many combination of this graph are possible**.
First let's find our x axis and y axis values.

    var length = Math.round(w/8); // This represent our x axis
    > Math.round(150/8)
    > 19 // This is how many x points we have

    curY = Math.round(Math.random() * (h-padding)); // this is our y axis
    > Math.round(Math.random() * 20)
    > 0 -> 20 // This is the highest y value we can have

We have a graph with 19 points varying between 0 and 20. In other words 20 possibilities * 20 possibilities * 20 possibilities... 19 times.
This adds up to 20^19, which amount to **5 septillion 242 sextillion and 880 quintillion possibilities**. A nice and round 25 decimals number.

We are only 7 billions people on this planet, with only [a third having an internet access](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm), or 2.5 billions individuals, give or take.

**Now the fun part**, if every of those user decided to refresh this page every second, it would statistically get a little **over 6.65 millions year** for every combination of this graph to run out.

It would also probably be the hugest DDOS attack we would ever see, but that's another story.

Anyway, I think it's fair to say that nobody will ever see **this page you are currently looking at** once you decide to close this tab and go on your way !

Startling, isn't it?
